.\" cligPart SYNOPSIS end

.\" cligPart OPTIONS
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -o
Output data file name (no suffix),
.br
1 String value
.IP -pkmb
Raw data in Parkes Multibeam format.
.IP -ebpp
Raw data in Efflesberg-Berkeley Pulsar Processor format.
.IP -pad0
Pad the data to the next power-of-2 with zeros.
.IP -padavg
Pad the data to the next power-of-2 with the average value.
.IP -numout
Output this many values.  If there are not enough values in the original data file, will pad the output file with the average value,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and oo.
.IP -nobary
Do not barycenter the data.
.IP -DE405
Use the DE405 ephemeris for barycentering instead of DE200 (the default).
.IP -dm
The dispersion measure to de-disperse (cm^-3 pc),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP infile
Input data file name.  If the data is not in PKMB or EBPP format, it should be a single channel of single-precision floating point data.  In this case a '.inf' file with the same root filename must also exist (Note that this means that the input data file must have a suffix that starts with a period).

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
