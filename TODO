Presto To-Do List in Order of Precedence as of 23 Nov 99.

--  Harmonic summing search

--  Make all character arrays use dynamic allocation to avoid
possible buffer over-runs.

--  Fix the fdotdot routines so they are accurate and faster.

--  Finish MPI-based searches.  (Use ParallelPython?).

--  Modify the Makefiles and package to use Configure.  Use Autoconf,
Automake, and Libtool.

--  Improve the documentation.  Maybe by using a source code
documentation system?

--  Use BLAS to speed up key loops (i.e. in the correlations)

--  Change times to use type Long Double?
