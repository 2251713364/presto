Presto To-Do List in Order of Precedence as of 01 July 99.

--  Modularize the rzw and binary search routines so that
they could be called interactively from Python.

--  Make all character arrays use dynamic allocation to avoid
possible buffer over-runs.

--  Finish MPI-based searches.  (Use ParallelPython?).

--  Modify the Makefiles and package to use Configure.  Use Autoconf,
Automake, and Libtool.

--  Perform extensive testing on the correctness of the pulse folding
and barycentering code since I think it could be messed up.

--  Allow FFTW to be called with non power-of-two length vectors.

--  Improve the documentation.  Maybe by using a source code
documentation system?

--  Change times to use type Long Double?
