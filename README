You must set an environment variable PRESTO to the top level presto
directory.  i.e. PRESTO = /home/ransom/presto
The best place for this is in your startup shell file.

You must also download the newest version of TEMPO and install it.
(I think the newest version is 11.004 as of October, 1998)

Make sure you have the environment variable TEMPO set.

For any of the plotting routines, you need PGPLOT v5.2

And finally, for optimal performance, you should download and install
FFTW.  http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~fftw/homepage.html
