.IP -numharm
The number of harmonics to sum (power-of-two),
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 16.
.br
Default: `8'
.IP -zmax
The max (+ and -) Fourier freq deriv to search,
.br
1 Int value between 0 and 300.
.br
Default: `170'
.IP -sigma
Cutoff sigma for choosing candidates,
.br
1 Float value between 1.0 and 30.0.
.br
Default: `2.0'
.IP -rlo
The lowest Fourier frequency to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.IP -rhi
The highest Fourier frequency to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.IP -flo
The lowest frequency (Hz) to search,

The highest frequency (Hz) to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.br
Default: `10000.0'
.IP -photon
Data is poissonian so use freq 0 as power normalization.
.IP infile
Input file name (no suffix) of floating point fft data.  A '.inf' file of the same name must also exist.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
