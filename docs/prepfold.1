.SH OPTIONS
.IP -pkmb
Raw data in Parkes Multibeam format.
.IP -ebpp
Raw data in Effelsberg-Berkeley Pulsar Processor format.  CURRENTLY UNSUPPORTED.
.IP -nobary
Do not barycenter (assume input parameters are topocentric).
.IP -DE405
Use the DE405 ephemeris for barycentering instead of DE200 (the default).
.IP -dm
The central DM of the search (cm^-3 pc),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -nsub
The number of sub-bands to use for the DM search,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 512.
.br
Default: `16'
.IP -npart
The number of sub-integrations to use for the period search,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 512.
.br
Default: `16'
.IP -p
The nominative folding period (s),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -pd
The nominative period derivative (s/s),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -pdd
The nominative period 2nd derivative (s/s^2),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -f
The nominative folding frequency (hz),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -fd
The nominative frequency derivative (hz/s),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -fdd
The nominative frequency 2nd derivative (hz/s^2),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -phs
Offset phase for the profil,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and 1.0.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -start
The folding start time as a fraction of the full obs,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and 1.0.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -end
The folding end time as a fraction of the full obs,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and 1.0.
.br
Default: `1.0'
.IP -n
The number of bins in the profile.  Defaults to the number of sampling bins which correspond to one folded period,
.br
1 Int value.
.IP -psr
Name of pulsar to fold (do not include J or B),
.br
1 String value
.IP -rzwcand
The candidate number to fold from 'infile'_rzw.cand,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and oo.
.IP -rzwfile
Name of the rzw search file to use (include the full name of the file),
.br
1 String value
.IP -bin
Fold a binary pulsar.  Must include all of the following parameters.
.IP -pb
The orbital period (s),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -x
The projected orbital semi-major axis (lt-sec),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -e
The orbital eccentricity,
.br
1 Double value between 0 and 0.9999999.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -To
The time of periastron passage (MJD),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -w
Longitude of periastron (deg),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and 360.
.IP -wdot
Rate of advance of periastron (deg/yr),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP infile
Input data file name.  If the data is not in PKMB or EBPP format, it should be a single channel of single-precision floating point data.  In this case a '.inf' file with the same root filename must also exist (Note that this means that the input data file must have a suffix that starts with a period).

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
