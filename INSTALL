Basic steps to install:

1.  Install FFTW3.  You need to compile FFTW for _single_
  precision (see the config flags I recommend below).

  For all architectures I recommend the following configuration:
  ./configure --enable-shared --enable-single

  Use the --prefix=SOME_PATH option to install the library and
  its related files to SOME_PATH.  (If you have admin access to 
  your machine, --prefix=/usr/local is the default for FFTW and
  is a safe bet).

  If you have a modern version of GCC installed (v3.2 or
  better) and a modern CPU (Intel Pentium III, IV, or newer;
  AMD Athlon or better), you can get drastically better performance 
  by using the following options:

  For Intel:
  --enable-sse --enable-sse2
  
  For Athlon:
  --enable-k7

  NOTE:  If you will do lots of precessing of WAPP data from
  Arecibo, I have a specially modified verion of FFTW3 that
  computes very fast custom DCTs for converting the correlator
  lags into spectra.  Let me know if you want it and I'll send
  it to you.

2.  Install PGPLOT.  http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/
  You need the X-windows and postscript drivers at a minimum.

3.  Install TEMPO.  Make sure to set the TEMPO environment variable.

4.  Install GLIB.
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/glib/ On Linux
  machines this is almost certainly already on your system
  (check in /usr/lib and /usr/include/glib*).  Although you may
  need to install a glib development package in order to have
  the required include files...

5.  Define the PRESTO environment variable to the top level
  directory of the PRESTO distribution (i.e. this directory).

6.  cd to $PRESTO/src.  Check and modify the Makefile for your
  machine of choice.  Insure that the library and include file
  directories are correct for FFTW, PGPLOT, GLIB, and TEMPO.

7.  If you are using FFTW, do a 'make makewisdom'.  This gets
  FFTW acquainted with your system.  It is best if you are the
  only user on the machine when you run this, as it is very
  computation intensive and may take a while.

8.  Do a 'make'.  This will make all of the executables.

9.  The required libraries and miscellaneous files will be
  located in presto/lib.  You may copy or move the executables
  wherever you like, but the library files should stay put.
  (That's why you define the PRESTO variable -- so the routines
  can find them).

10.  If you want to save some disk space, do a 'make clean' in
  the 'src' directory.  This will leave the libraries and
  binaries in their respective directories but will get rid of
  all the extra stuff in the 'src' directory.

11.  Go find pulsars.

Platform specific information:

DEC ALPHA --------- 
1.  In order to link the routines which use the pgplot libraries, 
  you may need to chance the Makefile so that instead of linking 
  with f77, you link with cc and the $(CFLAGS) variable.
